train: contains files to train the model (two training phases, adversarial finetuning, compute and save the embeddings), evaluate: experimental setup (evaluation, perturbations and whitebox attacks).
all relevant files must be present in the directory (e.g. dataset for training and evaluation, saved models for evaluation and fine-tuning, precomputed embeddings for evaluation).
