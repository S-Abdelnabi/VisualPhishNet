Code is written in python 3.7.6 and uses tensorflow 2.1 and keras 2.2.4
train: contains files to train the model (two training phases, adversarial finetuning), evaluate: experimental setup (evaluation, perturbations and whitebox attacks).
all relevant files must be present in the directory (e.g. dataset, models, precomputed embeddings). 
Code sanitization and documentation in progress. More details coming soon.
