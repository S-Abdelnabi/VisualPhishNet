Files for evaluation:
  - for the original dataset phishing pages 
  - for the newly crawled phishing data
  - Compute off-the-shelf-cnns embeddigs
  - applying random perturbation attacks on the phishing test set and calculate and save the new embeddings of the perturbed images.
  - applying whitebox adv perturbations on the phishing test set and calculate and save the new embeddings of the perturbed images.
  - adv closest: apply adv perturbations by sampling the closest example as the positive image, calculate and save the new embeddings of the perturbed images.
