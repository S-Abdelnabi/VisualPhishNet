Files for training: 
  - phase1: starts training, computes and saves embeddings at the end of training
  - phase2: fine tunes phase1 by hard subsets, should load the previously trained model, computes and saves embeddings at the end of training
  - adv: fine tunes on adv examples, should load the previously trained model, computes and saves embeddings at the end of training
